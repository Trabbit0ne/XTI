## Introduction
Cross-Title Injection (XTI) is a technique that allows attackers to bypass XSS protections by injecting malicious scripts into the <title> tag of web pages. This method takes advantage of unvalidated user input, enabling the execution of harmful code during the page rendering process. XTI poses significant security risks, including phishing, session hijacking, and the spread of malware, underscoring the need for effective input sanitization and security measures to prevent such exploits.

## Overview
This repository aims to educate developers and security professionals about XTI, its implications, and how to mitigate it effectively.

## Examples
Here are some scenarios where XTI can be exploited:
1. **E-commerce Platforms**: Malicious titles in product listings can execute harmful scripts when users view the page.
2. **Content Management Systems**: Users can inject scripts into post titles that execute when others view the post.
3. **Social Media**: Custom profile titles may be manipulated to run scripts on other users' browsers.

## Mitigation Strategies
To protect against XTI vulnerabilities, consider the following strategies:
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user input is sanitized and validated.
- **Output Encoding**: Use proper encoding techniques to prevent script execution.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to restrict script sources.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular assessments to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
